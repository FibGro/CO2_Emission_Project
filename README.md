## General Information
- This is ETL (extract, tranform and load)
- Implement mendalion architecture inn the Data Lake Gen2 (Brown, Silver, Gold) 
- Extract data from several sources into Brown layer of Data Lake Gen2 
- Cleaning, and ensure integrity the dataset 
- Transform the dataset into delta format
- Create a snowflake data modelling 
- Load into Silver layer
- Aggragate the data and load into Gold Layer for for feeding the analysis
- Connect Databricks with Power BI
- Create a dashboard and report in Power BI to show insight
